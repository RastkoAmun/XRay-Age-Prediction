# Bone Age Prediction

**BoneAgeNet**.

This project aims to automate bone age estimation using a deep learning model trained on thousands of pediatric hand X-ray images.
Our goal is to support radiologists and clinical decision-making by providing fast, accurate, and reliable predictions of skeletal maturity.
The model applies modern computer vision techniques to streamline what is traditionally a time-consuming and subjective process.

## 1. Example demo

A minimal example to showcase your work

```python
from amazing import amazingexample
imgs = amazingexample.demo()
for img in imgs:
    view(img)
```

### What to find where

This is how project acrhitecture should look like after:
1) data is downloaded and inserted
2) dependencies are installed in /venv

```bash
repository/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ amazing/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ amazingexample.py          # Demo and orchestration functions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ boneage-test-dataset/      # Test data images and CSV
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ boneage-training-dataset/  # Training data images and CSV
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ helpers/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils.py                   # Utility functions (helpers)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ preprocessing/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ preprocessing.py           # Data preprocessing scripts
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ preprocessing-sample.ipynb # Pre-processing test
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ preprocessing.ipynb        # Data preprocessing notebook
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ model-building.ipynb           # Model training and evaluation for bone age prediction
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ gender_classification.ipynb    # Model training for bone gender prediction
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ statistical-analysis.ipynb     # Analysis and visualization of model outputs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ run.py                         # Main script to run project workflow
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ submission.csv                 # Output from model predictions
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ results.csv                    # Additional result logs and metrics
â”œâ”€â”€ venv/                              # Python virtual environment directory
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt                   # Dependencies list

â””â”€â”€ .gitignore                         # Git ignore rules for unwanted files
```

## 2. Installation / Reproduction
Cloning and Dependencies Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository (choose HTTPS or SSH)
git clone https://github.com/sfu-cmpt419/2025_1_project_18.git
# or
git git@github.com:sfu-cmpt419/2025_1_project_18.git
cd 2025_1_project_18

# Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
python3.12 -m venv venv # python 3.12 must be used 
source venv/bin/activate #(on MAC)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Getting Data:
Original Data is too large and it takes a lot of time for pre-processing. So we provided already processed data that is only 300 MB in size. The .zip file also contains the csv file with training labels. Download data on the following link:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A-cas09uyZFP2XduVxvxr9A-7-ymrFlg/view?usp=sharing

After you download the data, unzip the folder and paste it in /src folder from repository

Reproduction
```bash

cd src/data
unzip boneage-dataset.zip
cd ../
python preprocessing/preprocessing.py train
python preprocessing/preprocessing.py test

python model-building.ipynb

python gender_classification.ipynb

python statistical-analysis.ipynb

python src/amazing/amazingexample.py

```
The model training produces a submission.csv in the source folder.
Generated plots and statistical outputs are saved as specified in the respective notebooks/scripts.

## 4. Guidance

- Use [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
    - Do NOT use history re-editing (rebase)
    - Commit messages should be informative:
        - No: 'this should fix it', 'bump' commit messages
        - Yes: 'Resolve invalid API call in updating X'
    - Do NOT include IDE folders (.idea), or hidden files. Update your .gitignore where needed.
    - Do NOT use the repository to upload data
- Use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or a similarly powerful IDE
- Use [Copilot for free](https://dev.to/twizelissa/how-to-enable-github-copilot-for-free-as-student-4kal)
- Sign up for [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/)
